# PolarBayes
A python package for "tidy data"-style analysis of Bayesian inference output using the Polars dataframe library

This package aims to be a spiritual Python port of the ``tidybayes`` package for the R/`tidyverse` ecosystem. It substitutes `polars` for the `tidyverse` and ArviZ `InferenceData` objects for `posterior::draws_df` objects.
